This document is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Bachelor of 
Engineering degree in \Department{}. The proposed project, \textit{\Project{}}, aims to address 
the increasing variety and sophistication of unsolicited SMS messages by developing an accurate 
and interpretable SMS classification system. The motivation for this work arises from the growing 
societal and economic impact of SMS-based spam, phishing, and fraudulent communication, as well as 
the increasing demand for transparency in automated decision-making systems used in security and 
communication domains.

Through this project, we seek to explore practical applications of artificial intelligence in 
cybersecurity, design a robust and user-friendly SMS spam detection framework, and contribute 
towards improving message safety and user trust through explainable classification mechanisms. 

This project is intended to be carried out under the supervision of \Supervisor{}\unskip, whose 
expertise and guidance are expected to be invaluable throughout the development process. With this 
\MakeLowercase\DocumentType{}, we formally seek approval to proceed with the proposed work and look 
forward to the opportunity to contribute to academic learning and applied research in artificial 
intelligence.

We, \Authors{}, hope that this \MakeLowercase\DocumentType{} clearly communicates the objectives 
and planned approach of the proposed \Project{}, and serves as a strong foundation for its 
successful execution under the guidance of \Supervisor{}\unskip.
