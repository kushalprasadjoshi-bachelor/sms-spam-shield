\section{SCHEDULE FEASIBILITY}

The proposed schedule is feasible within the allocated timeframe and available resources. 
Leveraging established machine learning frameworks, parallel development of incremental 
components, and a modular design reduces implementation risk and supports timely completion. 
Contingency buffers are incorporated for model tuning and integration.
