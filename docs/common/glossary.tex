\textbf{Short Message Service (SMS):}  
A text messaging service component of mobile communication systems used for exchanging short 
text messages between mobile devices~\cite{almeida2011contributions}.

\textbf{Spam:}  
Unsolicited or unwanted messages sent in bulk, often for advertising, fraudulent, or malicious 
purposes~\cite{almeida2011contributions}.

\textbf{Phishing:}  
A form of cyberattack in which deceptive messages attempt to obtain sensitive information such 
as passwords, banking details, or personal data~\cite{aibook2014}.

\textbf{Machine Learning (ML):}  
A field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make 
predictions without explicit programming~\cite{aibook2014}.

\textbf{Binary Classification:}  
A classification task in which input data is assigned to one of two possible classes, such as 
spam or non-spam.

\textbf{Multi-Category Classification:}  
A classification task in which input data is assigned to one of several predefined categories 
rather than a binary decision~\cite{aibook2006}.

\textbf{Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI):}  
Methods and techniques that make the predictions and internal behavior of artificial intelligence 
models understandable to humans~\cite{ribeiro2016why}.

\textbf{Black-Box Model:}  
A machine learning model whose internal decision-making process is not directly interpretable 
or transparent to human users.

\textbf{Logistic Regression:}  
A supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification that estimates class 
probabilities using a logistic function~\cite{aibook2006}.

\textbf{Naive Bayes Classifier:}  
A probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes’ theorem with an assumption of 
conditional independence among features~\cite{mcCallum1998comparison}.

\textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM):}  
A margin-based supervised learning algorithm that separates data points using an optimal 
hyperplane in a high-dimensional feature space~\cite{cortes1995support}.

\textbf{Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):}  
A neural network architecture designed for sequential data processing by maintaining internal 
memory states across time steps~\cite{aibook2014}.

\textbf{Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):}  
A specialized type of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-range dependencies by 
mitigating the vanishing gradient problem~\cite{hochreiter1997long}.

\textbf{Ensemble Learning:}  
A machine learning technique that combines predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy, 
robustness, and generalization~\cite{dietterich2000ensemble}.

\textbf{Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME):}  
An explainability technique that explains individual predictions by approximating the model 
locally using an interpretable surrogate model~\cite{ribeiro2016why}.

\textbf{SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP):}  
A unified framework for model interpretation based on cooperative game theory that assigns 
contribution values to individual features~\cite{lundberg2017unified}.
