This project proposes \textbf{\Project{}}, an intelligent and explainable system for 
classifying SMS~\nomenclature{SMS}{Short Message Service} messages into multiple actionable 
categories such as \emph{spam, phishing, promotional, transactional, and legitimate} messages. 
Unlike conventional binary spam filters, the proposed system aims to provide fine-grained 
classification while offering transparent, human-interpretable explanations for each prediction.

The system is designed to combine classical machine learning models, including Logistic 
Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM\nomenclature{SVM}{Support Vector Machine}, with a deep 
learning-based recurrent neural network 
(RNN\nomenclature{RNN}{Recurrent Neural Network}/LSTM\nomenclature{LSTM}{Long Short-Term Memory}). 
An ensemble-based aggregation strategy is employed to improve robustness and generalization across 
diverse SMS patterns. To address the black-box nature of automated text classifiers, explainable 
artificial intelligence techniques such as 
LIME\nomenclature{LIME}{Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations} and 
SHAP\nomenclature{SHAP}{SHapley Additive exPlanations} are incorporated to generate token-level 
explanations and confidence measures for classification decisions.

The project focuses on English-language SMS messages and utilizes offline-trained models evaluated 
using standard multi-class performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and 
confusion matrices. By integrating ensemble learning with explainable 
AI\nomenclature{AI}{Artificial Intelligence} 
(XAI\nomenclature{XAI}{Explainable Artificial Intelligence}), the proposed system aims to enhance 
both the accuracy and transparency of SMS spam detection, benefiting end users, system 
administrators, and researchers seeking interpretable and trustworthy text classification 
solutions.
